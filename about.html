          <h1>Sustainable Wood Boards</h1>
          <p>
            In addition to their exceptional quality, Fab Slabs is committed to
            environmentally friendly production of their kitchenware. They
            participate in planting and caring for native trees and other
            revegetation projects, and are active members of Land for Wildlife.
            Rather than using native trees for their cutting and chopping
            boards, they source salvaged Camphor Laurel logs, which are milled,
            dried, and turned into solid timber slabs that are both stylish and
            ethical. Camphor Laurels are considered an alien species in
            Australia, and there are programs in place to remove and replace
            them with native trees. By using salvaged materials, Fab Slabs
            prevents these logs from being wasted.

          <h1>Beautiful Wood Boards</h1>
          <p>
            Not only are Fab Slabs' cutting boards unique works of art, but they
            also create the ideal surface for food preparation and can be used
            as impressive presentation pieces for cheese and other appetizers.
            They are suitable for everyday use and are an essential item for any
            kitchen. Each board is produced with a unique grain, color, and
            character, making it an ideal gift for any occasion. Fab Slabs also
            offers bulk orders to cafes, butchers, restaurants, fruit and
            vegetable outlets, and gourmet delis. Investing in their kitchenware
            not only benefits your everyday needs, but also contributes to the
            economy and environment.

          <h1>Wood Board Care</h1>
          <p>
            To care for your Fab Slab cutting board, simply wash it with hot
            soapy water after each use, then dry it and store it away. When it
            appears dry, lightly oil it with an edible oil such as grapeseed
            oil. However, there are things to avoid: don't put it in the
            dishwasher, leave it in the sun, or soak it in water. Additionally,
            there is no need to rub salt or lemon into the board. Fab Slabs
            boards are naturally antibacterial and do not require salt or lemon
            to kill germs.

          <h1>Canadian Family Owned</h1>
          <p>
            Fab Slabs is a family-owned and operated business that takes pride
            in producing products that are 100% Canadian made. All cutting
            boards, or chopping boards, are milled, kiln dried, and manufactured
            on the Sunshine Coast, which is approximately one hour north of
            Ontario. This level of involvement ensures that every Fab Slabs
            product is made with care and attention to detail. The commitment to
            producing high-quality, locally-made products is at the heart of Fab
            Slabs, making them a trusted and reliable source for cutting boards
            in Canadian.

          <h1>Our Philosophy</h1>
          <p>
            Fab Slabs takes pride in crafting cutting-edge and stylish wooden
            camphor laurel cutting boards and grazing platters. The company is
            renowned for producing top-quality timber cutting and chopping
            boards that are not only aesthetically pleasing but also built to
            last, retaining their pristine condition even after prolonged use.
            Fab Slabsâ„¢'s secret lies in their use of Camphor Laurel timber, an
            introduced species to Australia, known for its exceptional
            durability and tight grain. The end result is a stunning and
            functional cutting board that is sure to elevate any kitchen or
            dining table.

          <h1>Wood Board Production</h1>
          <p>
            At Fab Slabs, we utilize state-of-the-art solar kilns to kiln dry
            our own timber, which can accommodate around 7500 boards
            simultaneously. This drying process is vital in maintaining the
            stability of the timber, preventing issues such as cracking,
            warping, twisting, cupping, and mold growth. By using kiln-dried
            timber, we can ensure that our cutting boards are crafted from a
            single slab, guaranteeing the stability of the finished product.
            Unlike other manufacturers, Fab Slabs does not use multiple pieces
            of laminated timber to create our cutting boards, instead relying on
            the quality of our kiln-dried Camphor Laurel.
